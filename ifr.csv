Mackie CFX 12 Channel Mixer,Mackie CFX 12 Channel Mixer,images/products/mackie-cfx12-mkii.jpg,$50.00 per day,$150.00 per week,$450.00 per month,"

Designed to take the hassle out of mixing live performances, Mackie's CFX.mkII Series compact live sound mixers feature genuine Mackie mic preamps, four subgroups, precise nine-band stereo graphic equalizers for greater sonic control, and onboard EMAC(tm) 32-bit digital effects - eliminating the need for outboard effects processors and cables. Combined with Mackie Active loudspeakers, the CFX.mkII mixers are part of a complete, easy-to-use Mackie sound system. <br /><br />&#13;
What's new in CFX.mkII? New impact-resisting rubber side panels for better durability. New ergonomic updates including sturdier, more precise Onyx Series knobs. And new graphics, for better visibility in less-than-ideal lighting conditions. Best of all, the new CFX.mkII mixers come at a suggested retail price significantly lower than the original CFX Series. <br /><br />&#13;
All CFX.mkII mic/line channels feature genuine Mackie mic preamps, renowned for their high-headroom, low-noise operation. Additional channel features include unbalanced inserts and input Trim controls with individual Zero Level LEDs, <br />&#13;
3-band EQ with swept midrange, and 100Hz low cut filters for eliminating mic rumble. Each channel strip has a 60mm log-taper fader, one external, and one internal/external effects send; plus two Aux sends, pan, mute, solo (PFL), and bus assigns. The mixers also offer phase-accurate 9-band stereo graphic EQ for easy tonal shaping (and feedback supression). All three models allow two separate stage monitor mixes to be created with their own effects levels. <br /><br />&#13;
Sweet touches abound on the CFX.mkII Series - like a simple, yet utterly handy Break Switch, that lets you mute all the channels, and instantly play any souce you've plugged into the Tape inputs. (Perfect for those moments when you have to take care of business offstage, and don't want some overzealous fan grabbing a mic to belt out ""Free Bird."") <br /><br />&#13;
Thanks to our massive digital R&amp;D efforts of the past seven years, we've developed sophisticated 32-bit digital effects that rival dedicated outboard processors. Our EMAC effects sound clean and realistic - especially compared to the crude, jangling 16-bit effects on most of the other ""effects"" mixers on the market. <br /><br />&#13;
Like all Mackie mixers, the CFX.mkII Series is designed for rugged, day-in and day-out road use. Their sturdy-yet-light steel monocoque construction houses rugged, double-sided SMT-plated fiberglass circuit boards, and 60mm faders with ultra-tight lip seals for keeping out contaminants. Onyx mixer-style knobs are mounted so they ""ride"" just above the steel chassis and absorb impacts without transferring damage to the internal components. And like all Mackie mixers, the CFX.mkII feature co-molded potentiometers that don't get brittle and scratchy sounding with age.<br /><ul><li>High-headroom mic preamps with RF rejection <br />&#13;

The <b>PSC M4-mkII</b> is a staple in the ENG sound department. With a couple of refinements implemented after its first production run, the M4-mkII is proving to be reliable and user-friendly. Using surface mount components, the 'mkII is about 10% smaller and lighter than the NGS-X4, but the remaining space is well used. The most notable unique feature is its internal battery compartment, which is capable of taking an NP-1 style battery, or a magazine (included) loaded with 8 AA cells. The power source is brought out to two 4-pin Hirose connectors that make 1.5A of power available for accessory gear such as wireless receivers. This  For a single output/return quick connector, the 'mkII uses the more standard 10-pin Hirose with pin-outs identical with other mixers using this connector (though one production run had 2 output pins reversed, creating bewilderment). The Lexan overlay labeling gives the mixer an almost toy-like appearance, but offers much greater protection and longevity than traditional silk-screened finishes.

Lectrosonics is pleased to introduce a new two-channel slot-mount Digital Hybrid Wirelss diversity receiver. The SR/5P receiver offers two independent channels and fits into the standard video camera slots found on professional cameras. The two audio channels can be fed separate inputs or can be mixed internally to feed a single input. 
<br /><br />&#13;
The two Digital Hybrid Wireless receivers inside the SR/5P offer 256 frequencies each in one of nine available blocks, and operate with any of the Lectrosonics 400 Series transmitters without a compandor in the audio path. In addition, compatibility modes also facilitate operation with Lectrosonics 100 Series, 200 Series, and IFB analog systems, along with analog transmitters from two other manufacturers. Transmitter battery strength is monitored in the SR/5P when using compatibility modes for 200 and 400 Series transmitters. &#13;
<br /><br />&#13;
While mounted on a camera, the SR/5P is splash resistantthanks to sealed membrane switches and LCD, along with a special gasket covering the slot opening. The SR/5P can be used with slot-equipped Sony, Ikegami, or Panasonic professional cameras via optional connector kits. &#13;
<br /><br />&#13;
NOTE: Not all cameras have two audio channels enabled in the slot. &#13;
<br /><br />&#13;
The SR/5P variant is equipped with an external audio output for cameras that only have one audio input in the slot. Both audio channels can be connected with an external cable

<p>Two components make up the ProVFM Viewfinder Mount Kit for Sony  PMW-F3 Kit. On the operator's side there is a mechanical mount, which  physically attaches the EVF and allows for approximately 1"" of front to  back adjustment. Traditional left to right adjustment is retained.</p>&#13;
<p>The second part is the electrical connection, which connects to the  non-operator side of the Berkey plate. The EVF plugs into the electrical  connection and there is a Lemo-7 jack on the back, which connects to  the supplied cable for both video signal and power.</p>&#13;

The FS-700 offers a wide range of framerates and recording options. Record continuous AVCHD 1080p video at up to 60fps, or shoot bursts of 1080p video at 120 or 240fps. Lowering the resolution allows burst recording at up to 960fps. Footage is recorded to easy to find SDHC memory cards, or to Sony's optionalFMU (Flash Memory Unit not available from Ohio HD).<br /><br />&#13;
The camera also features many pro industry standards, including both HDMI and 3G-HDSDI outputs, 2-XLR inputs, and built in switchable ND filters at 2, 4, and 8 stop increments. <br />"

Helmet, Roll Bar, Handle Bar, &amp; Suction Cup Mounts<br /><br /><p>GoPro’s HD Motorsports HERO is the world’s highest performance 1080p   HD on-board video and still photo camera. Professional quality 1080p,   960p, and 720p HD resolutions record at 30 frames per second (60 fps in   720p).  The HD Motorsports HERO easily mounts to any helmet,  motorcycle,  ATV, car, plane, jet ski, boat, snowmobile or other  vehicle. The  camera’s quick-release mounting design makes it easy to  re-position the  camera around your vehicle for professional quality HD  video from  several angles.</p>&#13;
<p>Record up to 2.5 hours on a single charge and up to 4.5 hours total  on a 16GB SD card.</p>&#13;
<p>Included are mounts for two helmets and three vehicles, as well as a   suction cup for maximum versatility and convenience. The housing is   waterproof to 180’ / 60m.</p>&#13;
<p>GoPro's obsession with sound has conquered the wind. At 85 mph on a   motorcycle, you’ll enjoy the throaty sound of your motor, not the wind.   Inside even the quietest street cars, hear the pull of your motor...not   the drone of the wind and road.</p>&#13;
<p>Included is a 1100mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery that lasts for   up to 2.5 hours of constant recording. With optional accessories, you   can also plug the camera into a wall outlet, cigarette lighter, or with   any USB-compatible power adapter, wire it directly to your vehicle’s   electrical system. The battery will charge while you record. </p>&#13;
<p>The camera can also shoot automatic 5MP photos at 2/5/10/30 and 60   second intervals during your drive or ride, hands free. Press the   shutter button once and record up to 2.5 hours of poster-print quality   photos.</p>&#13;
<p>Waterproof to 180’ / 60m and protected from rocks and other hazards   thanks to its removable polycarbonate housing.</p>&#13;

Panasonic HMC160,,images/products/hmc160.jpg,$200.00 per day,$600.00 per week,$1800.00 per month,"

The AG-AC160 features cutting-edge technology with its improved lens,  camera, and recorder sections.  The newly developed 22x zoom lens (28mm  to 616mm in 35mm equivalent), boasts a wide field of view and  capabilities much like an interchangeable lens, via a mechanical  (cam-driven) zoom ring, a focus ring, and an iris ring.  High-quality  full-HD 1920x1080 is achieved with a combination of a high-sensitivity,  low-noise, high-resolution 1/3-type 2.2-megapixel U.L.T. (Ultra  Luminance Technology) MOS image sensor and the professional AVCHD PH  mode.  Advanced functions like high-quality LPCM recording, HD  slow/quick-motion recording, HD/SDI output compatibility, DV (SD)  recording mode, and a switchable 59.94Hz/50Hz mode make this an ideal  camera for almost any type of production.  <br /><br />&#13;
Inherited from the VariCam, the Variable Frame Rate (VFR) function,  which is widely used for movie, television, and commercial production,  creates a wide range of film-cameralike images, such as overcranking for  slow-motion and undercranking for quick-motion effects, and supports  full-HD (1920x1080) progressive mode.<br /><br />&#13;
While the camera employs the AVCHD recording format, it also supports  the high-image-quality PH mode, featuring a compression efficiency that  is more than twice that of the MPEG-2 system (such as HDV), delivering  superb image quality and low data rates.  While in PH mode, it also  supports uncompressed 16 bit LPCM 2-channel digital audio recording.<br /><br />&#13;
Dual memory card slots allows Relay Recording, so you can seamlessly  record images onto two SDXC/SDHC memory cards consecutively, while  Simultaneous Recording records the same images onto two different memory  cards to increase reliability. The slot to be used can be switched  during normal recording, and clips can also be copied between the 2 slots.<br /><br />&#13;
The color EVF uses a 11.43mm (0.45 inches), approximately 1,226,000  dot-equivalent (852 x 480 x 3 [RGB]) LCOS (liquid crystal on silicon)  display panel. It delivers bright, detailed, high-resolution images and a  high response speed. The LCD monitor is comprised of a 87.63mm (3.45  inches), approximately 921,000-dot (1920 x 480) high-resolution panel.   <br />"

</ul><b>Sony's PMW-EX1R XDCAM EX HD Camcorder</b> is the impressive  successor to the popular PMW-EX1. While retaining everything that was  right about the previous camera, Sony has listened to its professional  users and taken several steps forward, not only improving ergonomics and  convenience, but bringing a whole new set of features to the world's  only full HD compact camcorder.<br /><p>Like its predecessor, the PMW-EX1R's core is its three 1/2""-type CMOS  sensors and 14x Fujinon zoom lens. This heavyweight imaging combo  captures full 1920 x 1080 hi-def images to solid state SxS PRO memory  cards at multiple bit rates, resolutions and frame rates. Whether you're  shooting weddings, documentaries or feature films, there's a frame rate  and resolution for you--from 60fps and native 23.98p recording at 720p,  to 1fps at 1080i.</p>&#13;
<p>But along with its already proven imaging abilities and professional  workflow, the PMW-EX1R expands its usability by offering DVCAM SD  recording, XDCAM HD compatibility, and HDMI output. That means no more  time-consuming downconverting or transcoding to work in different  formats or with different recording and playback devices. Other new  features add even more convenience and flexibility, including a  high-resolution 1.23MP viewfinder, Cache Record, one-click S&amp;Q  button, auto iris, and even image inversion for flipping the image while  shooting with a 35mm adapter. Make no mistake: the Sony PMW-EX1R is the  first HD compact camcorder that truly does have it all!</p>&#13;
<dl><dt> Three 1/2""-Type Exmor CMOS Sensors  </dt><dd> 		    		        The PMW-EX1R is equipped with three newly developed 1/2""-type  Exmor CMOS sensors, each with an effective pixel count of 1920 (H) x  1080 (V), which delivers excellent picture performance with full HD  resolution. This 1/2""-type image sensor, using Sony's advanced  accumulated sensor technologies, allows the camcorder to provide an  excellent sensitivity of F10, a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio of  54dB, and a high horizontal resolution of 1000 TV lines (in 1920 x  1080/59.94i mode). In addition, this large 1/2""-type image sensor can  capture images with a shallower depth of field than smaller-size image  sensors, giving users more creative freedom of expression. What's more,  the Exmor CMOS sensor's unique design deploys an A/D converter to each  column of pixels, resulting in a much lower clock speed than  conventional CMOS sensors. This makes it possible to greatly reduce  power consumption of the camcorder and extend battery life.  		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> 1920 x 1080 HD Recording Using the ""MPEG-2 Long GOP""  Codec  </dt><dd> 		    		        The PMW-EX1R records 1920 x 1080 full HD images using the  ""MPEG-2 Long GOP"" codec, which conforms to the MPEG-2 MP@HL compression  standard.

    <li>Can record up to 140 minutes of HD video and audio (using one 32-GB  memory card)</li>&#13;
    <li>Compact size: approx. 75 x 34 x 5 mm (excluding the projecting  parts)--half the size of the older PC Card standard</li>&#13;
    <li>Low power consumption</li>&#13;
    <li>Highly reliable: can resist shocks (up to 1500 G) and vibrations (up  to 15 G)</li>&#13;
    <li>Affordability: SxS-1 media (introduced in late 2009) provides users  with a lower cost alternative to SxS PRO media that offers the same high  performance, but with an estimated 5-year life span when recording at  full capacity once per day. Users can check the card life on their  PMW-EX1R and PMW-350 camcorders and even see an alarm when the data  rewriting limit is reached.</li>&#13;
</ul><p>*This data-transfer speed is a theoretical value. Actual  data-transfer speed depends on the file type and the performance of the  PC.</p>&#13;
</dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Wide Angle Professional 1/2"" HD Lens  </dt><dd> 		    		        The PMW-EX1R is equipped with a superb Fujinon 14x zoom lens  specifically designed for the PMW-EX1R to offer optimum picture  performance. It offers a wide angle of view of 5.8mm (equivalent to  31.4mm on a 35mm lens), and many other convenient features for both  broadcasters and videographers. 		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Unique Focus Operation - Professional Manual Focus and  Auto Focus  </dt><dd> 		    		        The Fujinon lens adopts a newly developed and unique focus  ring mechanism, which offers two types of manual focus, plus an auto  focus operation. The PMW-EX1R is equipped with two independent focus  wheel mechanisms, which can be switched by sliding the focus ring itself  back and forth.&#13;
<p>When the focus ring is in the front position, the lens works in the same  way as a typical auto focus lens on a handheld camcorder. In this case,  either manual or auto focus mode can be selected by the AF/MF switch on  the lens. On the other hand, when the focus ring is set to the back  position, the lens has an absolute focus position, and works in the same  way as interchangeable-lens cameras, which professional users are  familiar with.</p>&#13;
</dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Long Recording Time  </dt><dd> 		    		        Utilizing a mature and highly efficient compression format  together with high performance SxS memory cards, the PMW-EX1R can record  superb quality HD images for an exceptional 140 minutes* on a single  32GB SxS card. As the PMW-EX1R features two memory card slots, this  recording time is easily increased to 280 minutes (with two 32GB cards)  and when recording across two cards, the transition is seamless without  any frame loss. This feature makes the PMW-EX1R an ideal camcorder for a  wide variety of content production applications, including wedding and  event videography, that require a long recording time.&#13;
<p>*When recording in HQ (35Mbs) mode, recording time may be more than the  above specified figure depending on the actual bit rate that is adopted  during VBR encoding.</p>&#13;
</dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Multiple-format Recording  </dt><dd> 		    		        The PMW-EX1R offers a wide array of recording formats for  multiple content creation applications. In HD mode, scanning is  switchable between 1920 x 1080, 1280 x 720, and 1440 x 1080 resolutions.  Frame rate is also selectable from interlace and progressive: 59.94i,  50i, 29.97P, 25P, and native 23.98P.*&#13;
<p>In addition, 59.94P and 50P progressive recording is available in 1280 x  720 mode. In SD mode, both 50/60i and 25P/30P modes are supported.</p>&#13;

For SD recording,  industry accepted .AVI type-2 files have been adopted. The file-based  recording allows material to be handled with great flexibility in an  IT-based environment--easily available for copying, transferring,  sharing, and archiving. All these operations are accomplished without  any ""digitizing"" process required. File-based data copying allows for  degradation-free dubbing of AV content, which can be performed easily on  a PC or Mac. The file-based recording system also allows for material  to be viewed directly on a PC or Mac--simply by inserting the SxS memory  card into the ExpressCard slot, or by linking the device to the  PMW-EX1R via a USB2 connection. This works in the same way as a PC or  Mac reading files on an external drive. The file-based operation can  dramatically improve the efficiency and quality of professional video  applications. 		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Immediate Recording Start and No Overwriting Footage  </dt><dd> 		    		        By virtue of recording on flash memory cards, the PMW-EX1R can  start recording virtually the instant the camcorder is turned on.  Moreover, the PMW-EX1R system automatically records on an empty area of  the card--there's no danger of overwriting existing content. This is  extremely convenient, as camera operators do not have to worry about  accidentally recording over good takes, and they don't have to search  through footage for the correct position to start the next recording. In  short, it means the camera is always ready for the next shot! 		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Instant-access Thumbnail Search with ""Expand"" Function   </dt><dd> 		    		        Each time a recording is started and stopped on the PMW-EX1R  camcorder, the video and audio signals are recorded as one clip. During  playback, users can cue-up to the next or previous clip simply by  pressing the 'Next' or 'Previous' button, as you would do on a CD or DVD  player. Furthermore, thumbnails are automatically generated for each  clip as a visual reference, allowing operators to cue-up to a desired  scene simply by guiding the cursor to a thumbnail and pressing the  'Play' button. For further convenience, the 'Expand' function allows one  selected clip in the thumbnail display to be divided into 12 even-time  intervals, each with their own thumbnail identifier. This is useful if  you want to quickly search for a particular scene within a lengthy clip. 		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> New Image Inversion Function  </dt><dd> 		    		        When a cine-style lens or a stills camera lens is attached to  the camcorder with a DOF (Depth of Field) adapter, the image is usually  rotated by 180°. The Image Inversion function normalizes the image for  easy picture monitoring. This will also negate the need to flip the  image in post-production. 		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Three Independent Rings  </dt><dd> 		    		        In addition to its unique focus ring, the PMW-EX1R is equipped  with independent rings for zoom and iris adjustment.

</dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Slow &amp; Quick Motion Function  </dt><dd> 		    		        The PMW-EX1R offers a powerful Slow &amp; Quick Motion  function--commonly known as 'over-cranking' and 'under-cranking' in film  shooting--that enables users to create unique 'looks' or special  effects with slow- and fast-motion images. The PMW-EX1R can capture  images at frame rates selectable from 1 fps (frame per second) to 60 fps  in 720P mode and from 1 fps to 30 fps in 1080P mode, in increments of 1  fps. For example, when viewed at 23.98P, images captured at 60 fps will  appear 2.5 times slower than normal. Conversely, images captured at 4  fps will appear six times faster than normal. With the Slow &amp; Quick  Motion function of this camcorder, images are recorded natively without  interpolating the frames. This means the quality of the slow- and  fast-motion images is extremely high and incomparable to those created  in the editing process. In addition, these slow- and quick-motion images  can be played back immediately after shooting, without using any  converters or processing on non-linear editing systems. 		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> New One-push S&amp;Q Switch  </dt><dd> 		    		        A new S&amp;Q (Slow &amp; Quick Motion) button has been added  to the exterior of the camcorder.

Sony HVR-Z7U HDV Camcorder,,images/products/z7ufront.jpg,$300.00 per day,$600.00 per week,$900.00 per month,"

<p>The <b>Sony HVR-Z7U</b> is an HDV handheld camcorder featuring a lens  mount. Previously unheard of for such a compact unit, the HVR-Z7U  incorporates the convenience of a handheld camcorder with the  flexibility of larger ENG cameras.  <br /><br />&#13;
The camera can also record directly to compact flash cards, via the  camera's supplied memory recording unit. Combined with Sony's entire  family of HDV products, the HVR-Z7U is a great camcorder for almost any  production, including documentaries, news, low-budget movies, music  videos, and industrials.</p>&#13;
<dl><dt> Interchangeable Lenses </dt><dd> 					 			       		Users get the best of both worlds with this innovative  camcorder. The HVR-Z7U's unique design is the first of its kind; a  handheld camera with the interchangeable lens capability. Whether you  are filming a movie or shooting a documentary, the HVR-Z7U has it  covered. 			        	 				</dd></dl><dl><dt> ClearVID 3CMOS Technology  </dt><dd> 					 			       		Sony's ClearVID sensors are positioned at a 45° angle. Since  each pixel is positioned at this angle the result is far clearer  diagonal lines. Images will appear crisper, without the apparent  ""jaggies"" that often plague video signals.     			        	 				</dd></dl><dl><dt> Record to Compact Flash </dt><dd> 					 			       		The camera comes with an attachable recording unit, allowing  users to record HDV and DV to CompactFlash cards. With cards getting  larger and larger in capacity, the ability to take advantage of tapeless  workflow while still using cheap media is a welcome addition.  			        	 				</dd></dl><dl><dt> High Definition on MiniDV Tapes with HDV  </dt><dd> 					 			       		The HDV format, used in the HVR-Z7U allows high definition  recording on standard MiniDV tapes. This is accomplished by using the  very popular MPEG-2 compression technique used in many applications,  including DVDs and satellite television. 			        	 				</dd></dl><dl><dt> 24p Capability </dt><dd> 					 			       		In 24p mode, images from the CMOS can be 2:3  pulldown-converted and recorded onto tape in the standard 60i HDV  format. The tape can then be played back or edited using an ordinary HDV  system. True 24p editing can be achieved by uploading 2:3  pulldown-converted images via an i.LINK FireWire interface to a  compatible non-linear editing system. The resultant images resemble the  visual motion of film!  			        	 				</dd></dl><dl><dt> HDMI Output  </dt><dd> 					 			       		Many consumer products are adopting High Definition Media  Interface (HDMI) connections for transmitting uncompressed digital HD  video signals. Sony has upped the ante by incorporating this into the  already extensive array of video output choices on the HVR-Z7U. Connect  the camera to any HDTV via this interface and view all your footage the  way it was meant to be seen: purely digital!     			        	 				</dd></dl>"

</ul><span><em> 							 							</em></span>  					 					 					 					 					 						 										<br /><p>The <b>Canon EOS 5D Mark II</b> improves upon the EOS 5D by  increasing the resolution by about 40% to 21.1 Megapixels and adds a  Live View feature that allows users to preview shots on the cameras High  resolution 3.0"" LCD display. It even incorporates the ability to record  full motion HD Video with sound, so you can capture the action as well  as superb images.</p>&#13;
<p>The camera's 21.1Mp, Full frame 35mm-format (24x36mm) CMOS sensor  captures image files with incredible image quality and color accuracy,  and can capture JPEG, RAW and RAW+JPEG files. The camera also  incorporates Canon's acclaimed DIGIC 4 imaging processor that works in  concert with a high-speed DDR-SDRAM buffer to ensure quick performance  and fast image processing times. Performance enhancements enabled by the  DIGIC 4 processor include an incredibly fast full-resolution frame rate  of up to 3.9 fps, improved battery life, noticeably improved image  quality at all ISO sensitivities, fast start-up and reaction times, and  improved noise suppression at ISO sensitivities ranging from ISO 100 to  ISO 6400, plus the cameras sensitivity is further expandable to a range  of ISO 50 to ISO 25600.</p>&#13;
<p>The Canon EOS 5D Mark II incorporates a high-fidelity (920,000 dot) 3""  LCD screen and includes a 'Live View' feature that permits the user to  frame their shots on the LCD display, and adds framing functions that  are not possible with a traditional SLR viewfinder including the ability  to zoom in and navigate the preview image to ensure proper focus, and a  grid overlay to assist in proper composition. The Live View focusing  system also enables focus modes such as Quick mode, Live mode and Face  Detection Live mode. Furthermore, the Live View Feature enables HD video  recording that can capture true HD-quality (1080p) video at a frame  rate of 30 fps with Face Detection and sound.</p>&#13;
<p>The magnesium-alloy chassis of the EOS 5D Mark II ensures the durability  of the camera so users can take it on safari or to a press junket and  be assured that the camera can take it. In addition the camera body  incorporates extensive dust and weatherproofing features including seals  and gaskets where body panels and/or camera controls meet. To further  keep the imaging sensor free from dust, Canon's EOS Integrated Cleaning  System uses ultrasonic vibrations to shake dust particles off of the  sensor's low-pass filter each time you power up (or manually when  needed); this ensures that your images will be spot free and reduces  time needed for image retouching.</p>&#13;
<p>Other professional quality features found on the Canon EOS 5D Mark II  include 14-bit A/D conversion, a bright viewfinder (with 98% image  coverage), Auto Light Optimizer, Lens Peripheral Illumination  Correction, 9-point AF plus 6-point assist AF, 25 Custom Functions with  71 settings, and 5 metering modes (35-Zone EV, 8% Partial Spot, 3.5%  Spot, Center-Weighted, and Pre-Flash E-TTL II). Altogether, the Canon  EOS 5D Mark II has been designed to serve the needs and interests of  serious enthusiasts as well as professional photographers who are in  pursuit of the perfect image.</p>&#13;
<dl><dt> 21.1 Megapixel Full-frame CMOS Sensor  <br /><br /></dt><dd> 		    		        Developed by Canon, the high-resolution, 35mm full-frame CMOS  image sensor incorporated into the EOS 5D Mark II sets the standard for  its class, featuring a remarkable 21.1 million effective pixels for a  maximum recorded resolution of 5616 x 3744 pixels. And since the Image  sensor is Full Frame, all lenses used with the camera provide the angle  of view that was intended by the manufacturer - this is of particular  importance for photographers that often use wide-angle lenses and other  specialty lenses.  		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> DIGIC 4 Image Processor  <br /><br /></dt><dd> 		    		        DIGIC 4 is Canon's latest advanced imaging processor that  transforms data from the large CMOS sensor at extremely high speed for  photos of exceptional quality and definition. This accelerated  performance contributes to highly responsive, user-friendly operation,  including a fast continuous shooting speed. The DIGIC 4 Processor also  enables a number of processor intensive operations like Face Detection  Live mode, HD video recording and lighting and lens peripheral  optimization.  		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Live View Function  <br /><br /></dt><dd> 		    		        The Live View Function on the EOS 5D Mark II provides users  with a convenient way to frame images, by allowing for the cameras 3.0""  LCD Display to be used as a viewfinder - bringing a powerful feature  from the compact camera world to the professional digital SLR. Live View  is particularly useful when shooting at odd angles or when doing macro  photography. The Live view feature also enables the ability to zoom in  and navigate the composition 5x or 10x normal size; there is even a grid  overlay feature to aid in the composition of your images. The Feature  also enables the Live View focusing modes which include the Quick mode,  Live mode and Face Detection Live mode.  		         		        </dd></dl><!-- end else-if --><dl><dt> Record HD Video  <br /><br /></dt><dd> 		    		        The EOS 5D Mark II is unusual among SLR digital cameras in  that it is capable of recording Full HD video, and it's the cameras Live  View Function that makes it possible. You'll record video clips in Full  High-Definition with 1080p image quality and a capture frame rate of 30  fps with sound. Users can even attach an external microphone for  recording professional-quality audio with the video, and all Live View  AF features can be used when the camera is shooting video. Furthermore,  users can play back video clips on a HDTV display in full HD quality  with the cameras HDMI Video output (optional cable required). 		         		        </dd></dl><br />"

Helmet, Roll Bar, Handle Bar, Tripod, &amp; Suction Cup Mounts<br /><br /><p>GoPro’s HD Motorsports HERO is the world’s highest performance 1080p    HD on-board video and still photo camera. Professional quality 1080p,    960p, and 720p HD resolutions record at 30 frames per second (60 fps  in   720p).  The HD Motorsports HERO easily mounts to any helmet,   motorcycle,  ATV, car, plane, jet ski, boat, snowmobile or other   vehicle. The  camera’s quick-release mounting design makes it easy to   re-position the  camera around your vehicle for professional quality HD   video from  several angles.</p>&#13;
<p>Record up to 2.5 hours on a single charge and up to 4.5 hours total   on a 16GB SD card.</p>&#13;
<p>Included are mounts for two helmets and three vehicles, as well as a    suction cup for maximum versatility and convenience. The housing is    waterproof to 180’ / 60m.</p>&#13;
<p>GoPro's obsession with sound has conquered the wind. At 85 mph on a    motorcycle, you’ll enjoy the throaty sound of your motor, not the wind.    Inside even the quietest street cars, hear the pull of your  motor...not   the drone of the wind and road.</p>&#13;
<p>Included is a 1100mAh rechargeable lithium-ion battery that lasts for    up to 2.5 hours of constant recording. With optional accessories, you    can also plug the camera into a wall outlet, cigarette lighter, or  with   any USB-compatible power adapter, wire it directly to your  vehicle’s   electrical system. The battery will charge while you  record. </p>&#13;
<p>The camera can also shoot automatic 5MP photos at 2/5/10/30 and 60    second intervals during your drive or ride, hands free. Press the    shutter button once and record up to 2.5 hours of poster-print quality    photos.</p>&#13;
<p>Waterproof to 180’ / 60m and protected from rocks and other hazards    thanks to its removable polycarbonate housing.</p>&#13;

HPM100 P2 Recorder,Panasonic AJ-HPM100 P2 Recorder,images/products/PANASONIC.jpg,$300.00 per day,$900.00 per week,"$2,700.00 per month","

Called the P2 Mobile, this portable, rugged 4:2:2, 10-bit capable solid-state memory recorder/player is ideal for field production, postproduction as well as ENG applications. With the new AJ-YBX200 AVC-Intra codec board (option) installed, the P2 Mobile can record full-raster 1920 x 1080 or 1280 x 720p images with 10-bit sampling, which makes it well suited for ""video village"" use in the production of movies, TV series, documentaries, commercials and more. <br /><br />&#13;
The P2 Mobile features multi-format recording and playback with a six-slot P2 card reader, versatile inputs/outputs (HD-SDI, IEEE 1394, USB 2.0), an SD memory card slot, job/shuttle dial and up/down/cross conversion between 1080i and 720p and between high definition and standard definition formats. Plus, the P2 Mobile combines professional editing controls with audio faders, a 9-inch widescreen LCD monitor with stereo speakers, and a compact, magnesium die-cast body. It's a versatile and powerful mobile recording/editing solution for field recording (including pool feeds) and video production, as well as for use in mobile vans or in desktop non-linear/linear editing systems. <br /><br />&#13;
The P2 Mobile allows a user to record in DVCPROHD/50/25 and in AVC-Intra. The AVC-Intra codec board offers highly efficient encoding and extended recording time with 10-bit, 4:2:2 image quality. The AVC Codec offers two modes: AVC-Intra 100 Mbps for higher-end, full-bit HD quality and AVC-Intra 50 Mbps for storage efficient operation with high image quality. <br /><br />&#13;
With its extensive functionality and multiple-format video capabilities, the P2 incorporates the best of the AV and IT worlds, allowing you to work in 10-bit, 4:2:2 high definition or standard definition, bridging the gap between the P2 file format and baseband video. The P2 Mobile's capabilities enable you to excel at projects that require multiple video, audio, IEEE1394, RS-422 serial control for NLE connections, and let you take advantage of USB 2.0 to connect with industry-standard disk drives for consolidation of P2 card content.<br /><br /><ul><li>Records in 1080i and 720p with Up/Down/Cross conversion for playback</li>&#13;
    <li>Long record times -- with six 16GB P2 cards installed, the P2 Mobile can record for 96 minutes in AVC-Intra100; 96 minutes in DVCPRO HD; 192 minutes in AVC-Intra 50; 192 minutes in DVCPRO 50; and 384 minutes in DVCPRO.</li>&#13;
    <li>Six card slots allow you to record a continuous, extended clip in sequence onto six P2 cards. Or use five of the P2 slots for recording and use the sixth slot to output an edited playlist.</li>&#13;
    <li>Plays DVCPRO HD native frame rates -- 24pN/25pN/30pN that's been recorded with Panasonic's AJ-HPX2000, AJ-HPX500 or AG-HVX200 camcorders.</li>&#13;
    <li>Eight 16-bit digital audio channels with 5.1-channel surround sound.</li>&#13;
    <li>A multitude of broadcast-level interfaces -- switchable HD/SD SDIs, IEEE 1394 (AVC), USB 2.0, analog, composite, HD component and four-channel analog audio. If you're shooting in HD, but need to connect to an SD or analog monitor, the P2 Mobile has all the inputs and outputs you need. Its USB input/output makes it easy to copy all or select clips to a disk drive simple. Connection of multiple devices is simple and creating dailies copies with time code for screenings is a snap.</li>&#13;
    <li>Expedite editing by scrolling through thumbnail previews to view and edit clips immediately.</li>&#13;
    <li>Audio Split/Voice Over functions are standard</li>&#13;
    <li>Shuttle search at 100X normal speed in forward or reserve and jog search within a range of -1X to +1X speed -- ideal for high-quality, smooth, slow-motion replays.</li>&#13;
    <li>Great for back-up HD-SDI recording including automated recording via record flags with Panasonic HD camcorders (P2 HD models including AJ-HPX3000, AJ-HPX2000 and AG-HPX500 shoulder-mount, and DVCPRO HD models including AJ-HDX900 and AJ-HDC27 VariCam) or other tape-based cameras.</li>&#13;
    <li>Records master-quality video from Panasonic P2 HD shoulder-mount AJ-HPX3000 and AJ-HPX2000 camcorders</li>&#13;
    <li>Folds flat for easy transport and storage (weight: 14.4 pounds). AC/DC operation.</li>&#13;

Canon 30-300 PL,,images/products/Canon30_300PL.jpg,$500.00 per day,$1500.00 per week,$4500.00 per month,"

<p>The <b>Canon CN-E 30-300mm T2.95-3.7 L SP PL Mount Cinema Zoom Lens</b>  is designed expressly for digital cinematography with cameras that have  an APS-C or Super 35-equivalent sensor and a PL mount, including  Canon's EOS C300 PL. Featuring advanced optical technology designed by  Canon, the lens is suitable for any capturing any size HD image up to  and including 4K resolution.</p>&#13;
<p>With a focal length range of  30-300mm, the 10x cinema zoom lens is designed to cover the longer end  of the focal lengths typically required by cinematic productions, and  its maximum telephoto length of 300mm puts it among the best in its  class. (The other zoom lens in the line, the CN-E 14.5-60mm T2.6 L SP,  covers the wider end.) Maximum aperture is a relatively fast T2.95  throughout much of its range, and the 11-blade iris enables a smooth  bokeh for out-of-focus areas of the frame.</p>&#13;
<p>The lens was designed  with working professionals in mind, with easy-to-read focus, zoom, and  iris markings engraved into angled surfaces on both sides of the lens,  so you can read the setting from either side of a camera – or from  behind it. Depending on the production's needs, focus markings can be  switched from standard to metric. The lens facilitates manual operation  that's subtle, smooth, precise, and repeatable. Control rings are  designed to provide and maintain the proper amount of resistance so you  can operate with a consistent torque. The focus rotation angle is about  300°; for zoom, it's approximately 160°.</p>&#13;
<p>The CN-E 30-300mm  T2.95-3.7 L SP lens complements the other lens in the line in more ways  than just focal length range: Their shared 136mm front diameter, gear  positions, and rotation angle make them almost ""hot-swappable"" when  they're used with a shared matte box or follow focus.</p>

All HDx Optical Adapters also optically correct for the different  spectral alignments between three-chip prism block sensors, for which  the B4-mount lenses were designed, and the single sensor of the large  sensor cameras. HDx Optical Adapters are highly telecentric in design,  delivering a bright, sharp image across the entire frame, with excellent  color and contrast.

16x9 .75x Aspheric Wide Angle Converter for Sony PMW-EX1 & EX3,,images/products/EX3Wide.jpg,$50.00 per day,$150.00 per week,$450.00 per month,"

<div id=""prodtab1"" style=""display: block;"">&#13;
<p><strong>EX 0.75X Aspheric Wide Converter</strong></p>&#13;
<p>16x9 Inc. introduces the EX 0.75 Aspheric Wide Converter—<strong>the first wide converter to bring the benefits of aspheric technology to DV and HDV cameras.</strong> The top-quality optical solution for getting wider angle images from Sony's popular new PMW-EX1 and EX3 camcorders, <strong>the EX 0.75X provides a 25% greater angle of view while maintaining full zoom capability.</strong></p>&#13;
<p><strong>Aspheric Technology<br /></strong>The  EX 0.75's innovative, advanced technical design employs a  state-of-the-art aspheric lens element to more effectively reduce  geometric distortion and chromatic aberrations and improve off-axis wide  angle performance. Utilization of the aspheric lens surface allows the  other elements of the converter to be smaller and lighter—without it,  the spheric elements would have to be larger to achieve the same level  of performance. This helps keep the unit's size and weight at a minimum,  making it especially well suited for handheld work. The EX 0.75X  contains a total of four multi-coated optical glass elements—including  the asphere lens—that combine to yield clean and vivid, high definition  images.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Bayonet Mount<br /></strong>This lightweight,  compact optical accessory attaches securely to the front of the EX1 and  EX3 via a convenient bayonet mount. Installation and removal is quick  and easy. For professional shading and light control, the Aspheric Wide  Converter is fully compatible with the HU-104 Rubber Lens Shade.  Attaching firmly to the front of the converter through a handy  quick-lock mechanism, 16x9 Inc.'s rugged, broadcast-style shade is  designed to hold a 105mm round filter. In addition, the EX 0.75X  interfaces beautifully with popular mattebox and sunshade systems such  as those from Chrosziel.</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Meticulous &amp; Detailed Craftsmanship</strong><br />&#13;
Like  all of 16x9 Inc.'s 16x9 Inc.'s HD-quality EX lens accessories, the new  EX 0.75X is precision engineered and manufactured for optimum optical  performance. Craftsmanship is meticulous and detailed, using only the  finest grade materials.</p>&#13;

Not all HMIs are created equal. This HMI from Bron Kobold earns its place on the set with weatherproof construction.
When designing the lamp base and ballast, special emphasis was put on an efficient protection against dust and drip water. All openings are protected or sealed. The operating elements are equipped with a waterproof protective cap. The trigger unit is waterproof up to the bulb socket, allowing cold and hot triggering even in a humid environment.
<br /><br />&#13;
The lamp base housing is made from sturdy aluminum and steel. Despite the rugged design, and the various measures to make the equipment all-weather-proof, the weight and volume are comparatively small.&#13;
<br /><br />&#13;
An entire system in one case. &#13;
<br /><br />&#13;
- Electronic ballast unit for 100-240 V (automatic voltage selection), dimmable <br />&#13;
- Lamp base with HMI bulb 400 W, UV-coated protecting glass <br />&#13;
- Barn door with 4 wings, rotatable, with filter holder <br />&#13;

</ul><p>The Litepanels Low-profile series is a reconfiguration of the Spot,    Super-Spot and Flood 1X1s meant to be mounted parallel (horizontally)    with the ceiling or wall. Because the individual lenses of the LED  array   are tilted at 40 degrees off-axis, you don't have to tilt the  fixture,   making it possible to mount it with only three inches of  clearance  from  the surface. It's ideal for small rooms where floor  space or  headroom is  tight.</p>&#13;
<p>This <strong>Litepanels 1X1 Low-Profile LED Daylight  Flood Light d</strong>raws   just 40 watts and is driven by the included  100-240 Volt power   supply as well as a variety of DC battery  sources, such as the   Litepanels Backpack PowerCell (1.75 hours power).  The 1X1's  LEDs have a   50,000 hour lamp life, making it effectively  maintenance-free. </p>&#13;
<p>Among the features that professionals have  come to appreciate in the   series are the ballast-free design, 0-100%  dimming and virtually   heat-free operation. Options include  DMX modules, slide-in conversion   and diffusion filters and a wired  remote dimmer (purchased   separately). </p>&#13;
<dl><dt> Low-profile  </dt><dd> 		    		        <br />&#13;
The fixture mounts nearly flush with the ceiling or wall with  only   three inches of clearance from the surface. Because the individual  LEDs   in the 1X1 are tilted at 40 degrees, no tilting of the fixture is    required, allowing you to utilize room space that would have been    claimed by light stands or overhead brackets.  		         		        </dd></dl><dl><dt> Dimming Control  </dt><dd>  		    		        <br />&#13;

<span class=""productPage_longText""><b>ADC HUM-1 Humbucker Video Hum Eliminator</b> <br /><br />&#13;
Hum on video is caused by a multitude of reasons, all of which are  common throughout the world.  Hum in general is induced by four distinct  causes: 1) ground loop caused by difference in ground potential, 2)  electrostatic coupling, 3) magnetic coupling and/or 4) faulty circuit  elements causing leakage.  Hums caused by ground loops can be as large  as several hundred volts &amp; can be dangerous to a TV crew preparing  the site. <br /><br />&#13;
Common mode hum caused by differences in ground potential is often found  in long video cables, incoming and outgoing lines and separate power  distribution systems.  The Humbucker eliminates 99.6% of a 10V p-p, 60  Hz ground induced hum in a 200 ft. RG-59/U coax run.  Eliminates up to  20V p-p ground induced hum; up to 60 dB hum reduction.  Nominal  impedance: 751/2; BNC type connectors; either connector may be used as  input.  Comes in an aluminum die-cast box, with Handles.</span>                                                     <br />"

Our  patent pending mirror assembly offers both height AND angle adjustment  for perfect camera centering and presenter viewing angle.  The mirror  assembly also folds flat for fast, safe transport. The use of custom  aluminum extrusions (instead of heavy slab aluminum) combined with our  ultra light LCD panels make the ProLine the lightest prompters in their  class. The lightweight design eliminates the need for costly, heavy-duty  tripods and offers significantly improved panning and tilt performance.</p>&#13;

            Today’s high definition cameras demand equally high  performance optics. The All models utilize exclusive UltraClear HD  beamsplitter glass that uses ultra pure, low iron glass that eliminates  the color shift and light loss found in many competitive products. To  further improve performance we add an anti-reflection coating on the  back of the glass to virtually eliminate reflections that can bounce  back into the lens. For situations with high ambient light such as  direct sunlight we offer a “High Bright” glass that offers 25% brighter  viewing for the talent. We also offer our exclusive unbreakable acrylic  beamsplitter for use in shock prone applications.</p>&#13;

<p>Replacing  the renowned 2060HD, the new 2065 shares the ergonomic design of  OConnor’s higher-payload fluid heads like the popular 2575D and 120EX  models. Pan and tilt brakes are conveniently located on the left side of  the head--so operation is both intuitive and familiar. The 2065 also  copies many popular features of the 120EX. The platform is equipped with  dual scales, one on each side, and four handle rosettes to allow  operation from either side of the head as well as front or back handle  mounting.<br />&#13;
A handy one-touch platform release lever enables one finger  or hand action to undo the safety catch and open the lever, which  speeds deployment and location changes in the field.</p>&#13;
<p>With a greater payload and drag than its predecessor, this new  head weighs just 22.9 lbs. (10.4 kg) and has a payload of 0-71 lbs.  (32.2 kg). Because OConnor fluid heads can be counterbalanced down to 0  lbs., they are the perfect tools for the current art of cinematography,  where cameras keep getting lighter, lenses keep getting larger, and more  accessories are constantly being developed. No matter how a camera  setup is configured, OConnor can balance the payload.</p>

Attaching or  removing a single O-Grip Module from the camera system is quick and  simple -- a 5mm Allen wrench is all it takes.

The Steadicam Merlin is a lightweight, compact, and simple stabilizer system for small cameras. Supporting cameras up to 5lbs, the Merlin also folds quickly to pack away or for use as a shoulder rig. Unfold again and it's ready to go without endless rebalancing.<br /><br />&#13;
The Merlins dual-forward weighting system acts as an inertial dampener, making use of longer focal length lenses a possibility even with small, lightweight cameras.<br /><br /><br />"
Zacuto Double Barrel,,images/products/Zacuto_Double_Barrel.jpg,$45.00 per day,$135.00 per week,$405.00 per month,"

<span>The Double Barrel is a shoulder mounted dual handheld system  that uses our DSLR baseplate.  This kit works on any DSLR camera with or without battery grips as it is  infinitely adjustable in height. The baseplate attaches to your tripod  plate using the standard tripod plate screws; (2) ¼ 20” and (1) 3/8 16”.  Your camera can also be quickly released from the rig by turning the  red knob then pulling up on your camera. The camera quick release plate  stays mounted to your camera so you can quickly switch between using the  camera as part of a rig or on its own.    <br /><br />&#13;
The Double Barrel uses our shoulder pad and 7lb. counter balance weight  so you have a fully balanced rig.  A fully balanced rig lessens fatigue  as you will not be fighting the front heaviness of the rig. The rig can  be configured for use on the left or right shoulder.   The Z-Finder Pro 2.5x mounting frame attaches to the camera quick  release plate using two thumb screws. The mounting frame does not attach  to your LCD; it has a rubber back and simply sets or hovers over your  LCD screen.  This method allows you to quickly remove the Z-Finder by  snapping it off the frame. If you want to remove the entire mounting  frame, you can do so by loosening the thumb screws and pulling up on the  metal mounting frame to release it. <br /><br /><br />&#13;

This terminal outputs only incoming RGB analog signals from COMPUTER IN 1 / DVI-I terminal.<br /><br /><b>NETWORKING CAPABILITY</b><br />&#13;
The PLC-XU88 is equipped with SANYO's exclusive PJ-Net Master Network Interface software for wired and wireless networking, a common feature among SANYO's extensive line of commercial projectors. Networking allows the monitoring of projector functions and operation from a long distance via a web browser for up 15,000 Sanyo projectors. Emails can be sent automatically to report operating status. The wireless interface is compatible with IEEE802.11b/g standards, offering transfer speeds up to 54Mbps and providing WEP 64/128-bit security as well as, WPA and WPA2 security.<br /><br /><b>MEMORY VIEWER ALLOWS SD CARD</b><br />&#13;

To create a smoother, more professional presentation, logo and image files may be captured for display during the projector's countdown sequence at start-up.<br /><br /><b>POWER-OFF AND GO</b><br />&#13;
No need to wait for the projector to cool down. You can disconnect the power cord right after your presentation.<br /><br /><b>VARIABLE AUDIO OUT</b><br />&#13;
This convenient feature allows the user to control the audio level right from the projector. The centralization of video and audio controls from the projector helps in educational applications by ensuring the technical quality of the presentation and eliminating the fuss of separate outside audio controls.
